This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Udemy-Website Clone

A responsive React front-end replica of the udemy.com homepage (landing page), built with modern React practices and a clean component structure.  
All text, images, and UI content come from a centralized dummy data file for easy editing.

# Features
- Modern React front-end (Vite or CRA, depending on your setup)
- Component-based architecture (Navbar, Hero, Categories, Skills, Trusted Companies…)
- Dummy data stored separately in `src/data/dummyData.js`
- Fully responsive layout (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Clean, expandable structure—easy to add new sections later
- Simple styling using CSS (Flexbox + Grid)
